## Documentation for Scientist I

### Introduction

The purpose of this template is to help create a standardized workflow for scientists to build robust shiny apps for their pharmacometric models combining the power of shiny, NONMEM and R. 

### Features

The following features are available in the current template for you to get started.

 - __Pre-built modules__ Already configured set-up for modules for model creation, excution and post-processing. User may tweak further to their specific routines
 - __Example data & uploads__ Availability of data to test out the app, but also a feature that allows upload of user dataset for analysis
 - __Plot/table output and code download__ Download all output plots and tables either as final outputs (png/docx) or objects (ggplot/flextable/table1) or code download to direct use in submissions
 - __User customizable interface__. This means the user can move around the panels to desired locations on the screen. They may also change the title and color of the panels to suite their needs. 
 - __Panel location and features saved across sessions__. This means that after re-arrangement of panels, changing panel colors or titles, one may refresh the page and the settings are retained.
 - __Resizable Panels__. Panels are resizable to allow easy focus on specific contents, like plots or tables of result.
 - __Aesthetics for completion__. App title are formatted to look professional. A sample icon is also provided, which may be replaced when updating the template to suit your need.
